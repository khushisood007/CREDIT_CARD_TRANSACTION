# CREDIT_CARD_TRANSACTION
The "CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION DASHBOARD" project provides a comprehensive overview of credit card financial performance and customer behavior using Microsoft Power BI.
OBJECTIVE: To optimize revenue and transaction growth, and strategically manage customer acquisition and engagement across different card categories and customer segments.
INSIGHTS: 
1 Quarterly Performance Fluctuation: The third quarter showed the most transactions, but the first quarter brought in the most money. This suggests that even with many transactions, the amount of money made per transaction in the third quarter might have been lower. Following this, the last quarter experienced a decrease in both the money earned and the number of transactions compared to the third quarter.
2 Dominance of Blue Card: The "Blue" card category is by far the most successful, bringing in significantly more money, earning more interest, and collecting more in annual fees than any other card. This shows it is the main way the company earns income.
3 Chip vs. Swipe Usage: Transactions made by swiping the card bring in a lot more money than those made by using the chip. This might mean people prefer swiping, or that these transactions are for more expensive purchases.
4 High-Value Expenditure Types: Spending on "Food" and "Bills" brings in the most money for the company. Other significant contributors to revenue are spending on "Fuel" and "Grocery".
